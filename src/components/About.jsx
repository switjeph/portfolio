            I’m a full-stack software engineer who loves turning
            ideas into powerful digital experiences. Whether it’s crafting sleek
            user interfaces with React or building secure, high-performance
            backends using Node.js, PHP/Laravel, and MySQL, I thrive on solving
            real-world problems with elegant code. I enjoy working on meaningful projects that challenge me to grow, whether it’s deploying a booking platform, optimizing an ERP system, or integrating cloud-based APIs. I have a sharp eye for detail, a strong sense of design, and a deep curiosity for how things work under the hood. When I’m not coding, I’m learning new technologies, contributing to side projects, or helping small businesses bring their visions to life with smart digital solutions.
